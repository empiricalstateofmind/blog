Summary: Over the course of my studies I've worked on multiple different machines, with different operating systems, different hardware, and different security privileges. It can be a nightmare to ensure a smooth and consistent experience, but when done right, makes working with code and data a pleasure and makes academic reproducibility that much easier. In this article we will look at how the right choice of Python distribution, environment, and IDE can go along way to avoiding technological headaches.
